## Introduction

Crowd counting is a significant computer vision task with applications in crowd management, urban planning, and public safety. This project uses deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to achieve accurate crowd density estimation. The main goal is to provide an efficient and reliable crowd counting system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crowd-counting-cnn.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the crowd counting model on your dataset, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your dataset and annotations in the required format.
2. Preprocess the dataset as demonstrated in `data_preprocessing.ipynb`.
3. Configure the model architecture and hyperparameters in `crowd_counting_model.py`.
4. Train the model using `train.py`.
5. Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset using `evaluate.py`.

## Dataset

For training and evaluation, use a diverse crowd counting dataset. We recommend the XYZ dataset [cite the source here], but you can also use your own dataset by following our data preprocessing guidelines.

## Model Architecture

The crowd counting model is built using a custom CNN architecture optimized for accurate crowd density estimation. You can explore and modify the architecture in `crowd_counting_model.py`.

## Training

To train the model, run `train.py` with the appropriate configurations. You can set hyperparameters, batch size, and other training options in the script. As I have done the training for 10000 steps.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using `evaluate.py` on a separate test dataset. This script calculates performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results

We present some sample results in the `results/` directory. Additionally, visualize the crowd counting output using `visualization.py`.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve this crowd counting system. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. For major updates, please open an issue to discuss before making changes.
